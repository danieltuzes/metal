Dear Dr. Franklin:

I am writing to apply for the research assistant position advertised on Monster. I was intrigued when I read your report in International Journal of Oncology Science on the innovative use of nanoparticle-based therapeutics for cancer treatment, and would like to contribute to ongoing research in this specialty.

My background includes three years of professional research experience, including my current role as a graduate research assistant at DEF University’s Cancer Research Center and prior experience as a cellular biology research intern for XYZ Corp3a world leader in cancer research and treatment.

At DEF University and XYZ Corp, I gained exposure to research in gene cloning and electrophoresis. I mastered various blotting techniques; performed complex, cell-based assays; and become skilled in the use of flow cytometry (FACS) technology to complete advanced cell sorting, cell counting and biomarker detection. In each role, I earned commendations for the quality of my research, including data collection, quantitative analysis and results interpretation.

My academic credentials include a BS in cellular and molecular biology and an in-progress MS degree in the same, which I expect to complete this summer. Technical skills include Python, R, MATLAB and Tableau.

Having lost family members to cancer, I share ABC Company’s mission to find a cure. I want to continue contributing to research efforts furthering this important cause, and would welcome the chance to join your team.

To schedule a meeting, please call me at (555) 555-5555 or email mb@somedomain.com. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Matthew Billings
