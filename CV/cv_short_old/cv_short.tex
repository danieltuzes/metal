\makecvtitle
I am a post doctoral student in physics, earned my Ph.D. and M.Sc. in physics and did my research at FAU Nürnberg-Erlangen and Eötvös University, Budapest. My research interests include stochastic simulations and modelling of non-conservative systems, and verifying the predictions by experimental investigation. I exploit the efficiency of C++ and the compute power of GPGPU in my simulations.\vspace{0.5em}

\section{Education}
\textbf{2012--2019}: Ph.D. student at Eötvös University, Budapest and at Friedrich Alexander University Nürnberg-Erlangen, on the training program Materials science and condensed matter physics with the result of summa cum laude. Thesis title: Stochastic properties of dislocation motion and rearrangement.  % arguments 3 to 6 can be left empty

\textbf{2007--2012}: M.Sc.\ and B.Sc.\ at Eötvös University, Budapest on a training program for research physicists with the module Atomic and Molecular Physics. Thesis title (translated): Determining polarization of dislocation ensembles.

\section{Computer and language skills}
Intermediate level knowledge and practice in C++, used on a daily basis (classes, templates, lambdas, STL and other libraries). Intermediate level scripting practice in Gnuplot to visualize data and plot figures. Intermediate to advanced level in describing languages as LaTeX, Markdown and pandoc. Basic level practice in web technologies, which were explored as part of a former hobby as HTML, PHP, MySQL and JS.

Fluent in English (C1) and Hungarian (native), practicing German (B2), passive knowledge in French (B1).

\section{Experience}
\textbf{2012--2019}: PhD Student at Eötvös University, Budapest and at Friedrich-Alexander Universität, Nürnberg-Erlangen. Beside my studies and research, I was a teacher assistant and lecturer in the field of Mechanics. Detailed achievements and skills gained:
\begin{itemize}
\item wrote a stochastic simulations to integrate non-deterministic PDEs and 
improved the efficiency of existing PDE solver by a factor 2 using mathematical identities, and by a factor from 2 to 5, by eliminating cache mismaches; implemented the a stochastic model on GPU
\item developed a more impressive, sophisticated and sensitive way of analyzing patterns on a 2D scalar field
\item constructed study material from scratch; prepared setups for demonstrations and fast, live data visualization
\item initiated a new investigation topic in an international research group with an output of a PRB article
\item advanced level programming in C++: wrote code for different operating systems; used different compilers and options for different target systems and purposes; used STL intensively, along with industry-standard libraries, for example FFTW, LAPACK and CUDA; used classes, templates, lambdas
\item advanced level scripting in gnuplot, producing informative and impressive figures for data visualization
\item creating documentations in LaTeX, pandoc and different flavors of Markdown
\item intermediate level scipting in bash, regular expressions and git, basic usage of Python
\item high level of collaboration and cooperation in an international and multicultural environment, the ability to socialize and involve lonely researchers in the workgroup
\end{itemize}

\textbf{7.2019 -- 9.2019}: Production leader and manager at Franz-Fertig and DUNAPOL, Buchen and Budapest. After a major internal and external attack on the company DUNAPOL, I reconstructed the information technology system at DUNAPOL, commissioned by Franz-Fertig. I investigated the used technology and methods how the company was supposedly working and measured the damages. I recreated the IT infrastructure, including the automated production management system, and by involving database specialist, I repaired the damaged files. With the assistance of the company owner, I coordinated the transportation between the parent company and the subsidiary, ordered and arranged work for the employees and helped managing the acquisitions and the invoicing. Achieved skills:
\begin{itemize}
\item working in an employee - employer relationship
\item ordering and arranging tasks for workers below me
\item high workload: 12 hrs a day, 7 day a week for couple of weeks
\item using German and Hungarian side by side
\end{itemize}

\section{Publications, talks and presentations}
5 peer-reviewed articles in international journals with high impact factor, two of them are in the journal PRB, one article with first authorship. Co-author of the Analysis book for physicists at Eötvös University, and authored several smaller lecture notes.

Took part in numerous prestigious international conferences and seminars, held presentations and introduced his research results using posters too.
